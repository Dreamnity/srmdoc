In order to protect your resources and bases, Create a claim, which is as simple as using WorldEdit!

Here's how:
1. Obtain a wooden hoe
2. Right click anywhere to mark a claim corner
3. Repeat 2. but for another opposite corner
4. Now you've created your own claim!

If you have missclicked using claim _modification_ tool(wooden hoe), simply put your wooden hoe away from hand, and it will cancel your action
